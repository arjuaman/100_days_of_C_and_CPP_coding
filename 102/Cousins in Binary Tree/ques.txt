Cousins in Binary Tree


Given the root of a binary tree with unique values and the values of two different nodes of the tree x and y, return true if the nodes corresponding to the values x and y in the tree are cousins, or false otherwise.
Two nodes of a binary tree are cousins if they have the same depth with different parents.
Note that in a binary tree, the root node is at the depth 0, and children of each depth k node are at the depth k + 1.

Ex: Given the following root, x, and y…

      1
    /   \
   2     3, x = 2, y = 3, return false (2 and 3 are on the same level but have the same parent).
Ex: Given the following root, x, and y…

      5
    /   \
   3     2
  / \   / \
 4  7  9   8, x = 8, y = 4, return true.
