Transpose Matrix


Given a 2D integer array matrix, return the transpose of matrix.

The transpose of a matrix is the matrix flipped over its main diagonal, switching the matrix's row and column indices.
Ex: Given the following matrix numsâ€¦

nums = [
  [1, 2],
  [3, 4]
]
return a matrix that looks as follows...
[
  [1,3],
  [2,4]
]
