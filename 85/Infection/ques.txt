Given a 2D array each cells can have one of three values. Zero represents an empty cell, one represents 
a healthy person,  and two represents a sick person. Each minute that passes, any healthy person who 
is adjacent to a sick person becomes sick. 
Return the total number of minutes that must elapse until every person is sick.
Note: If it is not possible for each person to become sick, return -1.

0->empty
1->healthy
2->sick

Ex: Given the following 2D array grid…

grid = [
    [1,1,1],
    [1,1,0],
    [0,1,2]
], return 4.
[2, 1] becomes sick at minute 1.
[1, 1] becomes sick at minute 2. 
[1, 0] and [0, 1] become sick at minute 3.
[0, 0] and [0, 2] become sick at minute 4.
Ex: Given the following 2D array grid…

grid = [
    [1,1,1],
    [0,0,0],
    [2,0,1]
], return -1.
