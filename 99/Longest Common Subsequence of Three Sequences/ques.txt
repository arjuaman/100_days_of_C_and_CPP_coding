Longest Common Subsequence of Three Sequences


Problem Introduction:
Compute the length of a longest common subsequence of three sequences.

Sample 1.
Input:
3
1 2 3
3
2 1 3
3
1 3 5
Output:
2
A common subsequence of length 2 is (1, 3).

Sample 2.
Input:
5
8 3 2 1 7
7
8 2 1 3 8 10 7
6
6 8 3 1 4 7
Output:
3
One common subsequence of length 3 in this case is (8, 3, 7). Another one is (8, 1, 7).
