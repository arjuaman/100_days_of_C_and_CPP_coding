(FB)Phone screen locker/ Gym Locker


It is the end of the school year, and the graduating class of Moore Science High (n students in all) has decided to end the year by
making quite a lot of noise. They line up in the locker room, where all n lockers are closed. The first student runs down the row of lockers,
opening each one. Then, the second runs down, slamming every other locker (this is where the noise comes in).
The third student then runs down, opening (or slamming) every third locker, and so on until all n students have gone through,
each opening (or closing) each locker evenly divisible by i, where i is the ith student. Write a function that prints each locker state after each student is done.

Output:
["O", "O", "O", "O"]
["O", "C", "O", "C"]
["O", "C", "C", "C"]
["O", "C", "C", "O"]



This question is asked by Facebook. In a gym hallway there are N lockers. You walk back and forth down the hallway opening and closing lockers. On your first pass you open all the lockers. On your second pass, you close every other locker. On your third pass you open every third locker. After walking the hallway N times opening/closing lockers in the previously described manner, how many locker are left open?
Ex: Given the following value of N…

N = 1, return 1.
You walk down the hallway once and open the only locker.
Ex: Given the following value of N…

N = 2, return 1.
You walk down the hallway and open both lockers.
You walk back down the hallway and close the last locker.
