Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target


Given a sorted character array, letters, and a character, target, return the smallest character in letters that is strictly larger than target.
Note: Letters wrap around. If target is ’y’ and letters contains ’c’ and ’d’, return ’c’.
Ex: Given the following letters and target…

letters = ['a', 'b', 'c'], target = 'b', return 'c'.
Ex: Given the following letters and target…

letters = ['r', 'y'], target = 'z', return 'r'.
