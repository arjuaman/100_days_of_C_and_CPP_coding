Matrix Diagonal Sum


Given a two-dimensional NxN integer array, matrix, return the sum of all values along its two diagonals.
Note: If a value appears in both diagonals it should only be added to your sum once.

Ex: Given the following matrix…

matrix = [
  [1, 2],
  [2, 1]
], return 6 (1 + 1 + 2 + 2).
Ex: Given the following matrix…

matrix = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
], return 25 (5 is only added to the sum once).
