Car Fueling


You are going to travel to another city that is located 𝑑 miles away from your home city. Your car can travel
at most 𝑚 miles on a full tank and you start with a full tank. Along your way, there are gas stations at
distances stop1, stop2, . . . , stop𝑛 from your home city. What is the minimum number of refills needed?

Sample 1.
Input:
950
400

200 375 550 750
Output:
2
The distance between the cities is 950, the car can travel at most 400 miles on a full tank. It suffices
to make two refills: at points 375 and 750. This is the minimum number of refills as with a single refill
one would only be able to travel at most 800 miles.

Sample 2.
Input:
