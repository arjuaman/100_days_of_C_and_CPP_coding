Collecting Signatures


You are responsible for collecting signatures from all tenants of a certain building.
For each tenant, you know a period of time when he or she is at home.
You would like to collect all signatures by visiting the building as few times as
possible.
The mathematical model for this problem is the following. You are given a set
of segments on a line and your goal is to mark as few points on a line as possible
so that each segment contains at least one marked point.

Sample 1.
Input:
3
1 3
2 5
3 6
Output:
1
3
In this sample, we have three segments: [1, 3], [2, 5], [3, 6] (of length 2, 3, 3 respectively). All of them
contain the point with coordinate 3: 1 ≤ 3 ≤ 3, 2 ≤ 3 ≤ 5, 3 ≤ 3 ≤ 6.

Sample 2.
Input:
4
4 7
1 3
2 5
5 6
Output:
2
3 6
The second and the third segments contain the point with coordinate 3 while the first and the fourth
segments contain the point with coordinate 6. All the four segments cannot be covered by a single
point, since the segments [1, 3] and [5, 6] are disjoint.
