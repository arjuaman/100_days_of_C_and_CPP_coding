Given a 2D array containing only the following values: -1, 0, 1 where -1 represents an obstacle, 0 represents a rabbit hole, 
and 1 represents a rabbit, update every cell containing a rabbit with the distance to its closest rabbit hole.

Note: multiple rabbit may occupy a single rabbit hole and you may assume every rabbit can reach a rabbit hole. 
A rabbit can only move up, down, left, or right in a single move. Ex: Given the following grid…

-1  0  1
 1  1 -1
 1  1  0
your grid should look like the following after running the function...
-1  0  1
2  1 -1
2  1  0

Ex: Given the following grid…

 1  1  1
 1 -1 -1
 1  1  0
your grid should look like the following after running the function...
4  5  6
3 -1 -1
2  1  0
