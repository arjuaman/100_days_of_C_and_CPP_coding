Our goal is to make all numbers on the same step.
Rather than move n-1 numbers up every time, why not just move one number down?

so the problem is simple:

find the min
move other numbers down to min.
number of moves = nums[0]-min + nums[1]-min + .... +nums[n]-min = sum - n * min

just another way to think of the magic equation.
