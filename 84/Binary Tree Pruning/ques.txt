This question is asked by Amazon. Given the root of a binary tree where every node’s value is either 0 or 1 remove every subtree that does not have a 1 in it.

Ex: Given the following binary tree…

        1
      /   \
    1      0
Return the tree such that it’s been modified to look as follows…
        1
      /
    1
