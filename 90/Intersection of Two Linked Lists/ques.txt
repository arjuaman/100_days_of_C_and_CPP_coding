Intersection of Two Linked Lists


Given the reference to two linked lists, return the node at which they intersect.
Note: If the two lists never intersect, return null.

Ex: Given the following linked lists...

A: A1->A2
          \
           C1->C2->C3
          /
B: B1->B2
return a reference to node C1.
