We sorted the arrays.
Then the common elements were pushed to answer array. 

nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]

sorted num1 -> [4,5,9]
sorted nums2-? [4,4,8,9,9]
				^
				|
                pushed
				
ans =4;

sorted num1 -> [5,9]      -> 5,9    -> 9      ->9
sorted nums2-? [4,8,9,9]  -> 8,9,9  -> 8,9,9  ->9,9
                                                ^

											  pushed
ans = [4,9];

sorted num1 -> []
sorted nums2-> [9]

DOne when one empty.
