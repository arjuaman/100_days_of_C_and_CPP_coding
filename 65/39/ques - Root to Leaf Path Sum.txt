Root to Leaf Path Sum


Given a binary tree and a target, return whether or not there exists a root to leaf path such that all values along the path sum to the target.

Ex: Given the following tree…

      1
     / \
    5   2
   /   / \
  1  12   29
and a target of 15, return true as the path 1->2->12 sums to 15.
Ex: Given the following tree…

     104
    /   \
  39     31
 / \    /  \
32  1  9    10
and a target of 175, return true as the path 104->39->32 sums to 175.
